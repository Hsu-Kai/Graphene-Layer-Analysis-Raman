# Graphene-Layer-Analysis-Raman

analysis of the number of graphene layers using Raman spectroscopy: A quantitative relationship between the intensity of the graphene 2D band and the thickness was established [Micron 80 (2016) 20–23].

This program was developed based on the aforementioned paper: Measurement of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the 2D band determines the number of graphene layers. 
FWHM range about 30–45 (1/cm) => monolyer graphene
FWHM range about 45-60 (1/cm) => bilayer graphene
FWHM range about 60–75 (1/cm) => trilayer graphene

Operation of Raman conditions: RT ;  atmospheric pressure
